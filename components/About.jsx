            <p className="py-2 text-lg text-[#EEF5FF]">
              A passionate and dynamic full-stack web developer hailing from the
              beautiful landscapes of Nepal. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's
              degree in Computer Science at the University of Louisiana Monroe,
              I'm expected to graduate in August 2024.{" "}

              Passion and Motivation
            </span>
            <p className="py-2 text-lg text-[#EEF5FF]">
              Web development, to me, is like sculpting in the digital realm,
              where each line of code shapes a unique experience. What excites
              me most is the power to transform ideas into interactive,
              user-friendly realities. It's the thrill of finding the perfect
              blend of creativity and functionality, of bringing a vision to
              life with just a few keystrokes. One area that fuels my passion is
              crafting seamless user interfaces using JS frameworks like React.
              It's like painting a canvas with pixels, making every click and
              animation a part of a user's digital journey. I find joy in the
              versatility of languages like Python and the precision demanded by
              SQL when designing robust backend systems.

              Journey
            </span>
            <p className="py-2 text-lg text-[#EEF5FF]">
              My journey into computer science began in my home, where early
              access to a computer ignited a passion that shapes my career
              today. Programming, video editing, and gaming weren't just
              hobbies; they were gateways to endless possibilities. Thanks to my
              parents' wise decision to expose me to technology early on, my
              childhood curiosity evolved into a lifelong pursuit. Today, as I
              dive into coding and design, I carry the echoes of those early
              days. Each line of code reflects the enthusiasm of a child
              discovering the magic of computers. It's not just a career; it's a
              tribute to the curiosity nurtured in my youthâ€”a journey shaped by
              the foresight of parents who believed in the transformative power
              of technology. As I navigate web development's complexities, I'm
              not just a programmer; I'm a storyteller, an explorer, and a
              lifelong enthusiast grateful for the early exposure that turned
              fascination into a meaningful career.
